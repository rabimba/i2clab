Dr. Weidong (Larry) Shi is the 2013 recipient of the UH Computer Science Academic Excellence Award. This award recognizes trailblazing research not bounded by traditional disciplinary boundaries.

His research mission is to address existing and emerging challenges faced by the society with innovations in computing and technology. To accomplish this goal, his research team has made significant contributions in securing computing systems, in novel user authentication approaches for mobile computing, and in transforming the cloud-computing model. Larryâ€™s ultimate goal is to create transforming solutions under the model of everything as a service. His motivation originates from the trend that in the coming era, every technology will eventually become a service. This will profoundly change how research outcomes of computing science will be provisioned and adopted by society. His work is currently funded by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Homeland Security.
